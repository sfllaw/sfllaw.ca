    <h1>Talks and Seminars</h1>

    <p>I do talks and seminars for conferences.  I used to do them for the <a
      href="http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/events/">Computer Science
      Club</a>, the <a href="http://uw-dig.uwaterloo.ca/">UW Debian
      Interest Group</a>, and the <a
      href="http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/">IEEE Student Branch</a> and
    sometimes I generate handouts.</p>

          <div class="subtitle">Typesetting beautiful text</div>

          <p>Unix was one of the first electronic typesetting platforms.
          The innovative AT&amp;T <i>troff</i> system allowed
          researchers at Bell Labs to generate high quality camera-ready
          proofs for their papers.  Later, Donald Knuth invented a
          typesetting system called T<small>E</small>X, which was far
          superior to other typesetting systems in the 1980s.  However,
          it was still a typesetting language, where one had to specify
          exactly how text was to be set.</p>

          <div
          class="indent">L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<small>E</small>X
          is a macro package for the T<small>E</small>X system that
          allows an author to describe his document's function,
          thereby typesetting the text in an attractive and correct
          way.  In addition, one can define semantic tags to a
          document, in order to describe the meaning of the document;
          rather than the layout.</div>

          <p>Before the GNU project ever existed, before the phrase
          "Free Software" was ever coined, students and researchers
          at the University of California, Berkeley were already
          practising it.  They had acquired the source cdoe to a
          little-known operating system developed at AT&amp;T
          Bell Laboratories, and were creating improvments at a
          ferocious rate.</p>

          <div class="indent">These improvements were sent back to Bell
          Labs, and shared to other Universities.  Each of them were
          licensed under what is now known as the "Original BSD
          license".  Find out what this license means, its
          implications, and what are its decendents by attending this

          <div style="font-style: italic"><blockquote><p>
              The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
              freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
              Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
              change free software---to make sure the software is free for all
              its users.

                  GPL</div></object>
          </p></blockquote></div>

          <p> The GNU General Public License is one of the most influencial
          software licenses in this day.  Written by Richard Stallman for the
          GNU Project, it is used by software developers around the world to
          protect their work.</p>

          <p class="indent">Unfortunately, software developers do not
          read licenses thoroughly, nor well.  In this talk, we will
          read the entire GNU GPL and explain the implications of its
          passages.  Along the way, we will debunk some myths and
          clarify common misunderstandings.</p>

          <div class="indent">After this session, you ought to
          understand what the GNU GPL means, how to use it, and when
          you cannot use it.  This session should also give you some
          insight into the social implications of this work.</div>

          <p>Stephen Kleene developed regular expressions to describe
          what he called "the algebra of regular sets". Since he was a
          pioneering theorist in computer science, Kleene's regular
          expressions soon made it into searching algorithms and from
          there to everyday tools.</p>

          <div class="indent">Regular expressions can be powerful tools
          to manipulate text. You will be introduced to them in this
          talk. As well, we will go further than the rigid mathematical
          definition of regular expressions, and delve into POSIX
          regular expressions which are typically available in most Unix
          tools.</div>
