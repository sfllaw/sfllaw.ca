    <h1>I love myself!</h1>

    <p class="noindent">I got over that whole self-loathing thing a long
    time ago; shortly after I gave up on <a
      href="http://www.moq.org/">meta-physical</a> questions like "who
    are we?" "why are we here?"  I now concentrate on more important
    questions like "what is for <a
      href="http://www.foodtv.com/">dinner</a>?"</p>

    <p>I must admit, I am a very lousy <a
      href="http://www.mythology.com/echonarcissus.html">narcissist</a>.
    I have no reflective pool to look into; no glamourous photographs of
    me lying about this site.  In fact, there is nothing of great use on
    this page.  If you are a Simon groupie, I guess you'll just have to
    leave disappointed.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.deor.org/~jlv/">Julie</a> has convinced me to
    start a <a
      href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sfllaw/">LiveJournal weblog</a>.
    This one seems to be vastly more successful than my <a
      href="http://www.advogato.org/person/sfllaw/">Advogato
      weblog</a>, mostly because I seem to have less of a life hacking
    than I do other things.  Which is odd, I suppose, because I spend
    all my free time hacking.  Hmm&hellip;.</p>

    <p>On more mature consideration, I have realised that one
    <em>could</em> stalk me on-line.  It seems that I have this annoying
    habit of <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=sfllaw">leaving
      messages</a> for the world to see.  In fact, <a
      href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> has a whole bunch of
    <a
      href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=simon.law%40ablelink.org">embarrassing
      messages</a> from when I was a wee lad.</p>

    <h2><a id="resume">R&eacute;sum&eacute;</a></h2>

    <p class="noindent">There is one redeeming trait to this page.  It
    happens to link to various forms of my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, which
    seems quite useful to have.  I've got it in <a
      href="resume-sfllaw.dvi">DVI</a>, <a
      href="resume-sfllaw.pdf">PDF</a>, <a
      href="resume-sfllaw.ps">PostScript</a> and the ever popular <a
      href="resume-sfllaw.html">XHTML</a>.  You can find the source code
    to generate it in my <a href="../programs/#resume-sfllaw">list of
      programs</a>.</p>
